# On the up and up

No more rookie numbers - from now on, we're going to pump those numbers up.

We want to find the numbers which have digits which don't decrease when reading the number from left-to-right.
Example good numbers:

```txt
1
45
777
1245
```

Example unwanted numbers:

```txt
10
97
2099
```

How many "good" numbers exist between 0 and your input (inclusive)?
