# Emit time

Some people say the best times in life are those among friends or family. The actual best times however, are palindromic:

```txt
11:22:11
```

Your input is a list of times - for each time, how far away, in seconds, is the nearest palindromic time, in hh:mm:ss format? The answer is the sum of these differences.
For example, with input time:

```txt
13:41:00
```

The nearest palindromic time is

```txt
13:44:31
```

Which is 211 seconds away. Note that the nearest palindromic time might be in the past - a time in the past is still a positive number of seconds away.
