Arabic numerals are yesterday's news - real programming languages use Roman numerals. To assist in the transition, convert your input set of numbers into Roman numerals. Then, appropriately, throw some of that conversion effort away by using a Caesar cipher (A=1, B=2, C=3 etc) to convert the letters of the Roman numerals into decimal numbers. The sum of these values is the answer.

Note that Roman numerals are evaluated from the largest number to the smallest, so 99 is XCIX, not IC.
