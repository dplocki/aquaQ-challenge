# This is good co-primen

Co-primes, while not being the most exciting thing in the world, are extremely useful for cryptography (among other things). Numbers are co-prime if they don't share any common factors above 1.

For example, 15 and 8 are not prime, but have factors of 3 5 and 2 4 respectively, and so are co-prime. 15 and 9 are not co-prime, since they share a factor of 3.

For your input number, what is the sum of the positive co-primes of that number which are less than that number?

For example, the coprimes of 15 are

```
1 2 4 7 8 11 13 14
```

If your input was 15, the answer would be 60.
